       <p>For this project, I want to create an interactive exploration of my room that will show my relationship with young womanhood. I want users to be able to explore the room in a couple different ways.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>Move around the room with the cursor</li>
        <li>Hovering over sections to see what is clickable</li>
        <li>Clicking on sections to see details. This will change the image on the screen or open an overlay of a close up</li>
        <li>Hover over items in sections, where dialogue will be provided showing the items reason being included in the project</li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        In my initial sketches, I only have different layouts of my room. I need to continue to the imagery for the rest of my project. I am considering using actual images, instead of drawings, of the items I plan on including in my room. For example, I can photoshop select and image of my cat, and place him on my bed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of developement, I am currently working on getting the panning feature to work. To do so, I have consulted with Professor Mead. He has adviced me to use some example code provided in the course resources to help me write my own. I am planning by Thursday to have a semi-function panning feature and to have further developed my graphics.
