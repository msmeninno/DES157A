    <p class="post">When reading through <a href=”https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/”>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>, I thought it was interesting how different the backstories of images can be. With most of the images, I got the general sense of what was going on, and even got the locations of the images correct. However, I was not able to get into the mind of the photographer until reading the caption. I was not able to think what the photo represented without the context. I think this can be an issue in using images in interactive websites. If the context is not present or defined, the meaning can easily be lost. I also think too much imagery can lead users to skip past important information in order to explore the imagery. I found myself doing this when looking at websites with fancy animations that corresponded with scroll. I think that the use of images has to be done with intention and purpose, and not just to add visual pleasure.</p>

    <p class="post">When reading the article, I appreciated the specificity of the UI patterns and why those patterns are effective. Particularly, the concept of maintaining context really stood out to me. I have definitely experienced clicking through a website and suddenly ending up in a place I did not want to go. Having the right amount of context behind an overlay makes users less likely to panic exit. I also agreed with avoiding windows that pop up manually, because I will always click out of those. I thought this was ironic because I actually got one of these while reading the article and it really irritated me. I also appreciate the warning to use these overlays sparingly, because I can see how they interrupt user flow. If I am constantly being removed from interacting with the main page with every button I press, I am not going to interact with that website’s buttons.

    <p class="post">Based on the article, I am considering including a progress bar in my question answering. Although I do not plan to have many questions, I still think communicating progress towards completion would motivate the users to continue on through the task. I am going with a multiple choice format, where each step is a single question. I will also include a clear “next” button so the user does not have to spend time looking for how to progress to the next step.

I am inspired to do this because of a website I discovered last Valentine’s day called <a href="https://lovepawsona.io/">Love Pawsona</a>.In this website, multiple choice questions are used to determine what animal represents someone’s way of loving. I think this format will translate well because in my madlib, someone will be creating a Vampire persona through filling out multiple choice questions.
